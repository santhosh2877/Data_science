        Dhoni is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region. He plays pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries often putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly.<br> Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary.
        He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.He plays the <b>helicopter shot</b> technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal. As a batsman, he is recognized for his finishing skills in high-pressure situations.As a wicket-keeper, he has been praised for his fast reflexes behind the stumps while also being criticized for the lack of good technique.<br>He is known for his unorthodox captaincy, approachability and has earned a reputation of being a successful leader. Dhoni is also known for his cool-headed demeanor on the field which has earned him the monicker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni">"Captain cool"</a>.
